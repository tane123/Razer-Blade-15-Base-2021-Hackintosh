# Razer-Blade-15-Base-2021-Hackintosh
This is a OpenCore Hackintosh configuration for the new Razer Blade 15 Base 2021. 
I will be uploading fixes as I find issues.

## What works:
- Power Management (not 100%)
- IGPU without any bios modding like previous years
- Trackpad (GPIO) and Keyboard
- Audio
- Intel wifi (Can be iffy sometimes)
- Thunderbolt, patches are created but I have no devices to test with
- Battery Status, Using EC Enabler over tradintional DSDT patches
- Camera and Microphone
- USB ports are mapped

## What doesnt work:
-USB-C Displays and HDMI ports
+ If this is required I would reccommened picking up a display link dock or adapter
- RTX3070, no support until Apple decides to give licensing back to Nividia
